## Description
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses `Express.js` for routing, a `MongoDB` database, the `Mongoose` ODM, and `Moment.js` to format timestamps. The seed data is created using `Insomnia`.
